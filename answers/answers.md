#Architecture
1. CPU provides concurrency/parallelism while using Direct Memory Acess which allows the computer to do computations and access memory at the same time.
2. Machine language is binary which is writtine in bits to commang the CPU. Assembly language (asm) is a computer language which has a strong correlation between language and machine code isntrucitons.
3. Graphic cards take work away from the CPU hence making a higher performance.
4. Graphic cards can utilize the neural network with efficient parallel computing provided by GPU.
